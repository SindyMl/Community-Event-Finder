# Community Event Finder
A web app built for the Wits University community to discover and submit local events, such as tech meetups, career fairs, and cultural festivals. This project showcases my Python and Flask skills for the Wits Computing Museum opportunity.

## Features

- View and filter events by category (Tech, Career, Social, Academic, Cultural, Sports).
- Submit events with details like price (Free/Paid) and ticket types (Early Bird, General, VIP, VVIP).
- Professional, responsive design with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- SQLite database with sample events inspired by platforms like Computicket.
- Future potential: Integrate with event APIs (e.g., Eventbrite) for live data.

## Purpose
Built to demonstrate my programming skills for the Wits Computing Museum opportunity, addressing the need for a centralized event platform for students. The app mimics features of ticketing platforms like Computicket with a focus on usability and scalability.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate Eventbrite API for real-time event data.
- Add user authentication for event submissions.
